# SolarSystem Python Animation

This application is a simple solar system animation in Python using the Pygame library. It is a simple animation that shows the movement of the planets in the solar system.

It is a work in progress and needs additional details added, such as more planets, comets, moons, and more.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository demonstrate the power power of using LLMs with RAG to review code changes and look for code issues. The SolarSystem animation is just a small sample app to test the functionality.
